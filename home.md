# Welcome

#### Welcome to my github pages site, where I do my stuff.
- create pages using html, css, js, and markdown
- hide secret things
- practice coding

#### Why on earth do I do it?
- for free time
- to waste it
- because why not
- what else should I do?

#### How did I make this page?
Simply, I just use _markdown_ code. I only use this to **waste my time**, do not take this stuff seriously.
